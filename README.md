# Linearly Bounded Automata Simulator
## CS373 - Fall 2020
### Solo Project

***

## Project Description

This program simulates the processing and output of a finite automata.

## Use

The sample.txt file provides the simulator with the states and transitions needed to create the finite automata to be simulated.
To run the simulator, compile with javac then:
java simulator sample.txt  _0011__ 100
where the first argument is the input file, the second argument is the input langauge, and the third argument is the maximum number of transitions.
