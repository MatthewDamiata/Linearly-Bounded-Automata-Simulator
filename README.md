# Linearly Bounded Automata Simulator
## CS373 - Fall 2020
### Solo Project

***

## Project Description

This program simulates the processing and output of a finite automata.

## Use

The sample.txt file provides the simulator with the states and transitions needed to create the finite automata to be simulated.
To run the simulator, compile with javac then run:

```
java simulator sample.txt  0011 100

```
where the first argument is the input file, the second argument is the input string, and the third argument is the maximum number of transitions.
